# FrogBot
Super basic Discord robot to help me learn Python
this bot posts picture from the given link if they're stored in a specific folder on your computer
you will have to update this with the path to the given picture folder and your discord bot token
now i personally dont think this code is worth using since it's total novice garbage but it helps me feel like ive accomplished something
and thats all that matters to me because i can sit here and read all day but its not like anything is going to get done
